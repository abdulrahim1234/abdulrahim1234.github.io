        Output for the early non-turbo (1990–1995) 1JZ-GE was 170 PS (125 kW; 168 bhp) at 6000 rpm and 235 N⋅m (173 lb⋅ft) at 4800 rpm.
        Later released non-turbo (1995->) 1JZ-GE had output of 200 PS (147 kW; 197 bhp) at 6000 rpm and 251 N⋅m (185 lb⋅ft) at 4000 rpm.
        
        The 2.5-litre 1JZ uses over square bore dimensions 86 mm × 71.5 mm (3.39 in × 2.81 in) and, in naturally aspirated guise, a 10:1 compression ratio.
        With the aid of a DOHC, 24-valve head and a dual-stage intake manifold. Like all JZ-series engines, the early 1JZ-GE is designed for longitudinal mounting and rear-wheel-drive.
        All of these models also came with a 4-speed automatic transmission as standard; no manual gearbox option was offered.
